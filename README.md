# svg editor

The application is a web page that allows users to create an SVG image by starting with a background and then adding, modifying, and deleting figures to create the desired SVG image.

## Functionality

The application has the following features:

- Adding Figures: Users can add a figure (rectangle, circle, triangle, or line) by selecting a figure, choosing a color for the background and border, and then clicking the "Ajouter" button.

- Moving Figures: Users can move a figure within the background by using the "Up", "Down", "Left", and "Right" buttons. The figure cannot be moved outside the background.

- Modifying Figures: Users can modify the attributes (depending on the type of figure) of a figure by filling in the appropriate forms and clicking "Enter."

- Navigating between Figures: Users can navigate between figures by using the "Suivant" button to go to the next figure in the loop and the "Précédent" button to go in the opposite direction.

- Deleting Figures: Users can delete a figure by clicking the "Supprimer" button.
